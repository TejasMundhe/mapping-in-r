Rural is defined as the population not included within an urbanized cluster. The plot shown below maps the percentage of each state which is considered rural.

```{r warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}
rural_data <- get_decennial(geography = "state",
              variables = c("P001001","P002005"),
              year = 2010,
              output = "wide",
              geometry = TRUE)
```
